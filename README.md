Why Altium Designer
===================
The original project was made in KiCAD. This is a tool I do not know. I have been using Altium in one form or another since it came on a 720K floppy disk in 1986.
I'm simply way more proficient and productive using tools I know and have been using for decades. 
I Have provided all source files. Most PCB CAD tools can read Altium Files (KiCAD can), or there is a through another tool.

You have the source, there are (free) tools that can read it and manipulate it.
You also have the production data so you can send the board off to your favorite board fab.

Anything else is a discussion I do not want to engage in, or spend time and effort on.
